## Description

This is one of the projects on Andrei Neagoie’s Javascript Course. I changed a few small things such as adding a quote mark to the string sent to twitter, more concise self-explanatory naming conventions and a completely different API.

Project based on [JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/)

### Technologies

- HTML/CSS
- Vanilla Javascript

## How To Use

Pretty self-explanatory: upon loading it will show you a quote and if you like the quote press the twitter button and it will load the text and author’s name into a tweet for you. If you prefer a new quote, then press the “new quote” button.


### Quotable.io is the API reference returns in json format
<br/>

```html
    {"_id":"k3s9mCR6CK","tags":["friendship"],"content":"Friendship, like the immortality of the soul, is too good to be believed.","author":"Ralph Waldo Emerson","length":73}
```
